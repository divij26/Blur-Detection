Read this before running.

1. This is a small code written in jupyter lab.
2. Any library/framework is mentioned in the first cell itself. So you can download if it is not already there.
3. It took a lot of time to download the dataset so I was only able to start coding last night.
4. First few cells are commented out since I was not able to apply them in my work due to time constraint.

Running the code:

1. First of all, you would have to have the archive folder containing all the images in the same folder as he ipynb file.
2. I renamed all the images in sharp file as "und" to make dataset quickly. (Go to sharp folder, select all images and rename).
3. You can now run all cells in the given order. (First few are commented out for later improvement)
4. I used SVM to make classification.
5. For dataset I used a combination of laplace and fourier.

I couldn't add some more features and basic UI features but you can run the last function to upload an image and it will output Blurry or Not blurry.
